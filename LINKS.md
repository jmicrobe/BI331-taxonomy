Included below are links to resources and tutorials related to the topics covered in this exercise, including some great resources for getting started learning bioinformatics.

## Microbial ecology
* [The Human Microbiome Project](http://hmpdacc.org/) - The National Institute of Health's central repository for human microbiome data and research.  
* [Berkley Lab's Microbes to Biomes (M2B) Initiative](http://m2b.lbl.gov/about/) - Berkley Lab's microbiome projects focus on both human and soil microbiomes with an emphasis on revealing, decoding, and harnessing microbes.
* [Biology and the Built Environment at UO](http://biobe.uoregon.edu/) - This center at UO investigates the microbial ecology of indoor environments.
* [NASA's Astrobiology Program](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/about/history-of-astrobiology/) - Astrobiology is the study of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the Universe. Microbial ecology is an important part of this, including the study of microbes in extreme environments.

## Bioinformatics
### General
* [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) - This site provides some GREAT lessons for Git, python, R, and many other tools scientists may need to use. They also host live workshop events around the world.
* [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) - Focuses mainly on python and includes some beginning tutorials on using python with bioinformatics.
* [An Introduction to Applied Bioinformatics](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/An-Introduction-To-Applied-Bioinformatics) - A great, free resource to learning bionformatics from beginner to expert.

### R and RStudio
* [Swirl: Learn R, in R](http://swirlstats.com/) - This is a great package you can install within RStudio, serves as a great beginner's tutorial
* [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) - I use this page a lot for learning various tricks in R
* [RClub at UO](http://blogs.uoregon.edu/rclub/) - A very active club right here at the University of Oregon. They have an informative blog, meet often and offer workshops for beginners and intermediate users.
