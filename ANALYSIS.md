# Analysis tutorial

This tutorial will work you through the steps needed to complete the assignment. You should not need to install anything if you are using the laptops provided by the lab, but if you choose to do this on your own computer you'll need the following programs:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [RDP Tools](https://github.com/rdpstaff/RDPTools)
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

Note that the RDP classifier is also [available online](https://rdp.cme.msu.edu/classifier/classifier.jsp), however the output file may be slightly different from the command-line generated file we will use in class.
