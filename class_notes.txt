Ideas for class exercise

-wget to download fasta files? I'm not seeing an easy way

-github repo for class files! this would be great
  what about jupyter notebook?
  green lab class - doesn't provide script, but walkthrough md

-should I provide a script file as a template and they can edit?
  that might be good to get them thinking about *pipelines*

-presentation update? prezi? something more github friendly?
